                        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>The Australian city of Melbourne is experiencing a surge in real estate prices, making it difficult for potential buyers to find reasonably priced 2-bedroom units. In order to gain an edge
                        in the competitive real estate market and predict the next big trend, a hackathon challenge has been launched. The challenge requires participants to analyze data related to real estate prices and trends in Melbourne, and provide
                        insights and predictions that can help potential buyers to make informed decisions. The challenge will test the participants' skills in data analysis, visualization, and prediction, and will help them to gain valuable experience
                        in the field of real estate analytics.

                        <br>The objective of this task is to successfully develop a machine learning model which will help real estate agents, buyers and sellers to make informed decisions based on the predicted sale price of a property. Additionally,
                        it can be applied to improve residential property price strategies and support the assessment procedure. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the target you have assumed based on its features, and to identify
                        the key factors that contribute to the sale price.
